                    Welcome to the world of PowerPacks. Likewise our world everything consists of energy here, but sometimes the concentration of energy in the same place becomes great enough to turn it into the Power. We are to hunt for these Power particles, but we are not the only ones to get them - many powerful creatures are also seeking for it...<br><br>
                    You begin as one of the Power hunters. During your journey you will have to carve your path from a regular hunter to a great master of the Power. Each hunter has a personal pet and the goal is to grow up your loyal friend into a powerful creature during the journey and win the tournament of masters to occupy a place of honor in the Gold League.

                    As you finish your moves you get additional Power and gear for your creatures. At the beginning of every new move you can choose between spending Power on the evolution of your pet, saving it for a great deal, building a construction or sending it to the bank to get profit.<br><br>
                    Each cell of the playing field has its own features: battle, quest, dialogue, secret shop, trap, land auction, city, training camp, global event, mini-game. A more detailed gameplay description will come towards the release of the game.<br><br>
                    Evolution. Each pet has its branch of evolution which in the final version can turn it to more than 12 different powerful creatures. For example, a Golden Dragon attacks all enemy creatures with a fire breath. On the contrary, a Titan inflicts enormous damage on a single target only and a pack of Phantom Wolves can destroy a Titan losing just few of pack fellows.<br><br>
                    Random field generation, flexible branch of evolution, abilities and artifacts make every new playing session unique. It also eliminates the possibility of facing two identical creatures in the final battle.

                    In addition to the normal games a daily ranked tournament is planned. To participate in one of them you will have to deposit a fixed amount of PowerP (in-game token). 95% of the total amount contributed by all participants will be passed to the winner, 3% - will be burned to eliminate part of the emission to maintain the value of the asset and 2% comes to the prize fund of the main tournament of the season.<br><br>
                    All participants of tournaments receive ranks and hold a position in the ranking ladder. At the end of the season the leaders receive an NFT “ticket” which entitles to participate in the main tournament of the season. (After the end of the tournament, the new season begins and the leaderboard is reset).
